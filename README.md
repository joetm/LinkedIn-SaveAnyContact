Save Any Contact on LinkedIn
==============================

LinkedIn does not allow you to save third (or higher) degree contacts.
With this extension for the Google Chrome Browser, you can save any contact, even if you are not connected to the person.
The contacts are stored locally in your browser's storage.

Installation
============

Download the contents of this repository to a folder.
Go to the extensions manager in Google Chrome.
Click the "load unpacked extension" button and open the place where you stored this extension.

Usage
=====
On the profile, below the person's image, you will find a text "Save".
Clicking it will save this contact to your local list of contacts.

![Save Any Contact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joetm/LinkedIn-SaveAnyContact/master/screenshots/screenshot-3.jpg "Save any contact")

The contacts are listed on your contact list ( /conntected/#local-contacts ).
You can manage the contacts from that list ("connect" and "remove").

Warning - Read This!
====================

The contacts are stored in your browser's local offline storage.
That means two things:
1) if you clear your browser's data, your saved contacts will be lost.
2) the extension will (at the moment) not sync the contacts to Chrome browsers on your other devices. They will be stored only in the browser in which they were saved.

TODO
====
* Add to Chrome Web Store
* Improve position of the contact list on the network page
* Sync to other browsers.
